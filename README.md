## About the Project

This system was developed as a **Database Systems (CS 2005) course project** at FAST-NUCES Karachi. It addresses the challenge patients face when trying to find qualified doctors — no centralized platform exists to compare specialists by experience, fees, location, and verified patient reviews.

The system supports three user roles:

- **Admin** — manages doctor verifications, reviews, specializations, and hospitals
- **Doctor** — manages profile, availability, appointments, and medical notes
- **Patient** — searches for doctors, books appointments, and leaves reviews

---

## Features

## Database Design

### Normalization

All 12 tables are normalized to **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**.

### Tables (12 total)

| Table                    | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`                  | Stores login credentials for all roles            |
| `admins`                 | Admin profile data                                |
| `doctors`                | Doctor profile and verification status            |
| `patients`               | Patient demographics                              |
| `specializations`        | Master list of medical specialties                |
| `doctor_specializations` | M:N junction — doctor ↔ specialization            |
| `hospitals`              | Hospital directory with pending verification flag |
| `doctor_hospitals`       | M:N junction — doctor ↔ hospital                  |
| `availability`           | Doctor weekly time slots                          |
| `appointments`           | Appointment bookings and status                   |
| `appointment_notes`      | Medical notes written by doctors                  |
| `reviews`                | Patient ratings and comments                      |

### Key Constraints

- **Soft Deletes** — All tables have `deleted_at` for data retention
- **ON DELETE CASCADE** — Used for most relationships
- **ON DELETE SET NULL** — Used for `patient_id` in appointments and reviews (preserves history when patient is deleted)
- **Unique** — `users.email`, `doctors.license_number`, `reviews.appointment_id`, `appointment_notes.appointment_id`
